# FormValidator üìù

FormValidator is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to validate user input in a form. Users are prompted to enter their first name, last name, email address, and password. If any input field is left empty, an error message is displayed. Additionally, if the email address is not entered in the correct format, an error is shown. Once all inputs are filled correctly, a success message is displayed to the user.
